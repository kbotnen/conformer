###Introduction:

* Do you get a lot of unwanted email? yes,
* Do you want to stop all this from reaching your inbox? yes,
* Do you get hold of a blacklist in csv format that you can not import directly to gmail? yes,

If you answered yes to all of the 3 above questions you have been in the same situation as me, and maybe this little snippet can help you out.

###Future plans:

* take the csv file from input parameter
* take the resulting mailfilter filename as input parameter
* take "wanted action" as input parameter

###Installation:
